The rod in the figure is supported by the finger and the string.
The tension $T$ in the string depends on the distance $b$ of the
finger from the free end of the rod. 
As in the examples
in section \ref{subsec:sketch-without-equation}, sketch the function
$T(b)$ without knowing its equation. The domain of the function
consists of the physically possible values of $b$ that allow the
system to be in equilibrium. You should be able to determine
both the $x$-intercept and the $y$-intercept.
