Suppose $x$ is a big, positive number. Experiment on a calculator to figure
out whether $\sqrt{x+1}-\sqrt{x-1}$ comes out big, normal, or tiny.
Try making $x$ bigger and bigger, and see if you observe a trend.
Based on these numerical examples, form a conjecture about the
limit of this expression as $x$ approaches infinity.
