The galactic empire has been pretty successful at crushing the
rebel alliance, but there are still rebels laying low, scattered
around in various solar systems. The empire offers a bounty $x$
for the severed head of each rebel that is brought to the Dark Lord.
Let $f$ be the fraction of the rebels who are caught by the freelance
bountry hunters.
As in the examples
in section \ref{subsec:sketch-without-equation}, sketch the function
$f(x)$ without knowing its equation. You should be able to infer whether
or not $f'(0)=0$.
