Prove the following theorem. Let $f$ be a real function whose
second derivative is defined and continuous. If $f''$ is
sometimes positive and sometimes negative, then $f$ has
a point of inflection $x$, and $f''(x)=0$. Note that
$f''(x)=0$ is not the definition of a point of inflection,
and that the theorem fails for a function on the rational
numbers.
