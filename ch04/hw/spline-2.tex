A function $f$ is defined by 
\[
f(x)= \begin{cases}
  x^3 & \text{ for } x<-1\\
  ax+b & \text{ for } -1 \leq x <1\\
  x^2 +2 & \text{ for } x \geq 1.
\end{cases}
\]
where $a$ and $b$ are constants.  The function $f$ is continuous. What
are $a$ and $b$? Hint: Compute the one-sided limits.\answercheck
