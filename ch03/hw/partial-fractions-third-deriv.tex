The equation 
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{2x}{x^2-1}= \frac{1}{x+1}+\frac{1}{x-1}
\end{equation*}
holds for any value of $x$ for which both sides are defined.
(There is a general method, called the method of partial fractions, for rewriting
a rational function such as the left-hand side in terms of a sum of simpler
functions as in our right-hand side.)
Compute the third derivative of $f(x) = 2x/(x^2-1)$ by using either the
left or right hand side (your choice) of the equation.\answercheck
