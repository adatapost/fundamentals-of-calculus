The equation 
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{2x}{x^2-1}= \frac{1}{x+1}+\frac{1}{x-1}
\end{equation*}
holds for all values of $x$ (except $x=\pm1$), so you should get
the same answer if you differentiate both sides.  Check this.\\

Compute the third derivative of $f(x) = 2x/(x^2-1)$ by using either the
left or right hand side (your choice) of the equation.\answercheck
