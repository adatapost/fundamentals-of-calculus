Consider the function 
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
If we calculate $f^{(n)}(0)$, we seem to get
$1\cdot2\cdot\ldots n$. This product of the first $n$ natural numbers
has a name, the factorial, and a special notation, $n!$. As a special
case, we take $0!=1$.\index{factorial}

Proof by induction was introduced in section \ref{subsec:natural-powers}, p.~\pageref{induction}.
Use induction to prove that $f^{(n)}(0)=n!$.
