A blimp of mass $m$ is initially at rest, and then
the pilot turns on the propellers. The propellers gradually
speed up, and while they're speeding up, the force accelerating
the blimp is given by $F=kt$, where $k$ is a constant.
Show that there is a function of the form $x=ct^p$ that
satisfies Newton's second law, and determine the constants
$c$ and $p$.\answercheck\hwendpart
