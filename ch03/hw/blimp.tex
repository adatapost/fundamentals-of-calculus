A blimp of mass $m$ is initially at rest, and then
the pilot turns on the propellers. The propellers gradually
speed up, and while they're speeding up, the force accelerating
the blimp is given by $F=kt$, where $k$ is a constant.\\
(a) If time is measured in units of seconds (s), mass in kilograms (kg), 
and force in $\zu{kilogram-meters}/\zu{second}^2$ ($\kgunit\unitdot\munit/\sunit^2$) infer the units of $k$
(section \ref{sec:more-about-units}, p.~\pageref{sec:more-about-units}).\hwendpart

(b)
Show that there is a function of the form $x=ct^p$ that
satisfies Newton's second law, determine the constants
$c$ and $p$, and substitute these to find $x(t)$.\hwendpart

(c)
Check that the units of your answer to part b make sense.
