Proof by induction was introduced in section \ref{subsec:natural-powers}, p.~\pageref{induction}.
Use induction to prove that
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der^{n+1}}{\der x^{n+1}} x^n = 0
\end{equation*}
if $n\ge0$ is an integer.

Suggestion: To get an idea of what's going on, calculate the derivative for the first few values of $n$.
Then formulate a convincing explanation of what's going on. Then find a way to reduce case $n$ to
case $n-1$, and formulate a proof by induction.
