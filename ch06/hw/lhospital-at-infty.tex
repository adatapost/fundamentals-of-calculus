Section \ref{subsec:lhospital-proofs}, p.~\pageref{subsec:lhospital-proofs},
demonstrates the use of changes of variable in proving variants on l'H\^{o}pital's rule.
As suggested on p.~\pageref{subsubsec:lhospital-proofs-at-infinity},
do this for limits at infinity, using the change of variable $X=1/x$.
