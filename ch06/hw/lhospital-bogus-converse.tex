The following rule sounds very much
like l'H\^{o}pital's:
\begin{center}
  \itshape if $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)} {g(x)}$ exists,
  then $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)} {g'(x)}$ also exists,
  and the two limits are equal.
\end{center}
But this is not always true!  Find a counterexample.
