Let $t$ be the time that has elapsed since the Big Bang. In that time, one would imagine that light, traveling at speed
$c$, has been able to travel a maximum distance $ct$. (In fact the distance is several times more than this, because
according to Einstein's theory of general relativity, space itself has been expanding while the ray of light was
in transit.) The portion of the universe that we can observe
would then be a sphere of radius $ct$, with volume $v=(4/3)\pi r^3=(4/3)\pi(ct)^3$. Compute the rate
$\der v/\der t$ at which the volume of the observable universe is increasing, and check that your answer has the right units,
as in example \ref{eg:pest} on page \pageref{eg:pest} and section \ref{sec:more-about-units} on p.~\pageref{sec:more-about-units}.
Hint: We're differentiating with respect to $t$, and the thing being cubed is not
just $t$, so this is not a form that you know how to differentiate. Use algebra
to convert it into a form that you do know how to handle.\answercheck
