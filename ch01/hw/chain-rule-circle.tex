A circle has area $a$, diameter $d$, and radius $r$.
Express $a$ in terms of $r$,
$d$ in terms of $r$, and
$a$ in terms of $d$.
Find the derivatives $\der a/\der r$, $\der d/\der r$, and $\der a/\der d$.
The Leibniz notation suggests that we should have
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der a}{\der r} = \frac{\der a}{\der d}  \frac{\der d}{\der r}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Is this actually true?
