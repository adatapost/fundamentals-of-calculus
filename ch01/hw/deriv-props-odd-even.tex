An even function is one with the property $f(-x)=f(x)$. For example, $\cos x$ is an
even function, and $x^n$ is an even function if
$n$ is even. An odd function has $f(-x)=-f(x)$. 
Use the horizontal flip property of the derivative
(p.~\pageref{properties-of-derivative}) to prove that the derivative of an even function is odd.
