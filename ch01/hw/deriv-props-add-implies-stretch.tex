Section \ref{subsec:properties-of-the-derivative} on p.~\pageref{subsec:properties-of-the-derivative}
defines the addition and vertical stretch properties of the derivative.
If we assume that the addition property is true, prove that the vertical stretch
property must hold for any stretch factor $r$ that is a natural number
(1, 2, 3, \ldots).
