The role of examples and counterexamples in proofs was introduced in
box \figref{proof-not-by-example}, p.~\pageref{fig:proof-not-by-example}.
Sally claims that any function $y=x^n$, where $n$ is a natural number,
has $y'=0$ at $x=0$. To prove this, she gives a correct calculation
of the derivative of $y=x^4$ at $x=0$.
(a) Explain why her proof is incorrect.
(b) Disprove her claim by giving a counterexample.
