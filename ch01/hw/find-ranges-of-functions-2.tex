Consider the following four functions:
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= x^2-2x+\pi \\
  g(u) &= u^{18}-2u^9+\pi \\
  h(v) &= \ln(v^2-2v+\pi) \\
  k(w) &= \tan^2 w-2\tan w+\pi
\end{align*}
Determine the minimum value of each function.
Although you may be able to get approximations to the answers by
graphing, that does not constitute a proof of the exact result, which
is what is required here.
If you've forgotten some of your precalculus mathematics, you
may wish to review trig from
section \ref{sec:trig}, p.~\pageref{sec:trig} and logarithms
from section \ref{sec:exp-and-log}, p.~\pageref{sec:exp-and-log}.
It is possible
to do this problem without knowing how to differentiate the functions
$\ln$ and $\tan$; instead, reason about how the inputs and output of
the functions work, and think about how the construction of functions $h$ and $k$
relates them to functions $f$ and $g$.\answercheck
