Consider the function $f$ defined as follows:
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) = \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if $x\le0$} \\
    x^2 & \text{if $x\ge0$} 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

(a) Sketch its graph. If you're not sure what it would look like, try to gain
insight by calculating points for a few values of $x$, including values that
are positive, negative, and zero.\hwendpart
(b) On p.~\pageref{tangent-line-informal} I gave an informal definition of the
tangent line and the derivative in terms of zooming in on a graph. Does
this function have a well-defined tangent line at $x=0$? A well-defined
derivative?\hwendpart
(c) On p.~\pageref{no-cut} I defined a special type of tangent line called
a no-cut line, and the definition requires that the no-cut line be unique,
i.e., there is not more than one line with the given properties. Is there a no-cut line at $x=0$
for this function?
