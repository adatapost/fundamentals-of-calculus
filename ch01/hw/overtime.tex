A factory produces widgets, and the cost of production for
a given year is $an+bn^2$, where $n$ is the number produced,
$a$ is the basic cost of producing one widget, and $b$
represents the fact that in order to increase volume, the
factory must take expensive steps such as adding a night
shift, paying overtime, or offering higher wages in order
to attract more and better workers. The widgets are sold
at a fixed unit wholesale price $k$, and there is unlimited demand.\\
(a) Find the optimal number of widgets that the factory
should produce. \answercheck\hwendpart
(b)  Check that your answer has the right units, as in example 
\ref{eg:pest} on page \pageref{eg:pest}.\hwendpart
(c) Interpret the case where $b=0$.\hwendpart
(d) Interpret the case where $k<a$.\hwendpart
