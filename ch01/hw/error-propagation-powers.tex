Suppose that we measure a quantity $x$ and compute from
it $y=kx^n$, where $k$ is a constant and $n$ is a natural
number. Let $\Delta x$ be an estimate of the amount of possible 
measurement error in $x$, and let $\Delta y$ be the corresponding
error estimate for the output of the calculation. \\
(a) Show that
if $\Delta x$ is small compared to $x$, then
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\Delta y}{y} \approx n \frac{\Delta x}{x}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
(b) Vernier calipers are used to measure the length of the sides
of a square tile to a precision of 0.1\%.
Use the result of part a to find the possible
error in an area computed from this length.
