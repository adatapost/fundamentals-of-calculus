A hobbyist is going to measure the height to which her model rocket rises at the peak of
its trajectory. She plans to
take a digital photo from far away and then do trigonometry to determine the height,
given the baseline from the launchpad to the camera and the angular height of the rocket
as determined from analysis of the photo. Comment on the error incurred by the inability to
snap the photo at exactly the right moment.
