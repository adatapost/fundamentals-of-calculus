A line passes through the point $(0,1)$, and is also tangent to the
curve $y=cx^3$, where $c$ is a constant. Find the $x$ coordinate of
the point of tangency. Check that your result has the right sign when
$c$ is positive, also makes sense when $c<0$,
has the correct trend as $c$ gets closer to zero, and does something appropriately
nasty if $c=0$.
