A function of the form $U=1/(1+e^r)$ occurs in nuclear physics,
and its derivative is interpreted as the force acting on a neutron
or proton when it is at a distance $r$ from the center of the nucleus.
Use the technique in section \ref{subsec:approximating-deriv} to
obtain a numerical approximation to the derivative of this
function at $r=1$. Find an answer accurate to
three decimal places.\answercheck
