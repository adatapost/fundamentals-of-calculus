A sphere has volume $v$, diameter $d$, and radius $r$.
Express $v$ in terms of $r$,
$d$ in terms of $r$, and
$v$ in terms of $d$.
Find the derivatives $\der v/\der r$, $\der d/\der r$, and $\der v/\der d$.
The Leibniz notation suggests that we should have
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der v}{\der r} = \frac{\der v}{\der d}  \frac{\der d}{\der r}   \qquad .
\end{equation*}
Is this actually true?
