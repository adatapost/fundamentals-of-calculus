The role of examples and counterexamples in proofs was introduced in
box \figref{proof-not-by-example}, p.~\pageref{fig:proof-not-by-example}.
The addition rule for the derivative (p.~\pageref{properties-of-derivative})
tells us that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.
Huy proposes that the same thing holds for multiplication:
that the derivative of a product is the same as the product of
the derivatives. Disprove Huy's proposal by giving a counterexample.
