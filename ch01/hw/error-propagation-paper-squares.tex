Joe offers to make square sheets of paper for
Eileen.  Given $x>0$, Joe plans to mark off a length $x$ and cut out a
square of side $x$.  Eileen asks Joe for a square with an area of 4 square
meters.  Joe tells Eileen that he can't measure \emph{exactly} 2 meters and
the area of the square he produces will only be approximately 4 square
meters.  Eileen doesn't mind as long as the area of the square doesn't
differ more than $0.01$ square meters from what she asked for.\hwendpart

(a) What is the biggest error Joe can afford to make when he
marks off the length $x$?

(b) Cindy also wants square sheets with area $4$ square meters.
However, she needs the error in the area to be less than $10^{-5}$
square meters.  (She's paying.)
How accurately must Joe measure the side of the squares he's going to cut
for Cindy?
