Kinetic energy is a measure of an object's quantity of motion; when you buy gasoline,  the
energy you're paying for will be converted into the car's kinetic energy (actually only some of
it, since the engine isn't perfectly efficient). The kinetic energy of an object with mass
$m$ and velocity $v$ is given by $K=(1/2)mv^2$. For a car accelerating at a steady rate, with
$v=at$, find the rate $\der K/\der t$ at which the engine is required to put out kinetic energy.
$\der K/\der t$, with units of energy over time, is known as the \emph{power}.
