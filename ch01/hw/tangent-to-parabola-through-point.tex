A certain line has the following properties: (1) It passes through the point $(0,-c)$, where $c$ is
a positive constant. (2) Its slope is positive. (3) It is a tangent line to the parabola $y=x^2$.
Find the slope of the line. Check that your result makes sense in the special case $c=0$, that
it shows the correct trend as $c$ grows, and that it does something appropriately nasty if, contrary
to assumption, $c$ is negative.
