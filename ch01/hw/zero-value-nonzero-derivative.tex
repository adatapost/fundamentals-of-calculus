Let $m$ be an amount of money. There are many examples from business,
personal finance, and government in which it makes sense to imagine
that $m$ is a function of time, $m(t)$. Make up an example in which
$m(t)=0$ but $m'(t)\ne0$. (Don't make up an equation, just explain
a situation where this would happen and how it would be interpreted.)
