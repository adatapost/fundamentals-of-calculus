An equilateral triangle has sides of length $s$, perimeter $p$, and area $a$.
Express $a$ in terms of $p$,
$p$ in terms of $s$, and
$a$ in terms of $s$.
Find the derivatives $\der a/\der p$, $\der p/\der s$, and $\der a/\der s$.
The Leibniz notation suggests that we should have
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der a}{\der s} = \frac{\der a}{\der p}  \frac{\der p}{\der s}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Is this actually true?
