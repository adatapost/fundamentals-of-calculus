Children grow \emph{up}, but adults more often grow in the
horizontal direction. Suppose we model a human body as
a cylinder of height $h$ and circumference $c$. The person's
body mass is given by $m=\rho v$, where $v$ is the
volume and $\rho$ (Greek
letter rho, the equivalent of Latin ``r'') is the density.
Find $\der m/\der c$, the rate at which body mass
grows with waistline, assuing constant height and density.
