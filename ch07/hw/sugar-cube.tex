A sugar cube dissolves
in hot tea so that the edge of the cube decreases
at a rate $r=\der\ell/\der t$.
(a) How fast is the volume $V$ of
the cube changing when the edge has length $\ell$?
(b) Check that your answer has units that make sense.
(c) Evaluate your answer numerically for $\ell=5.0\ \zu{mm}$
and $r=-0.3\ \zu{mm}/\sunit$
(millimeters per second).
