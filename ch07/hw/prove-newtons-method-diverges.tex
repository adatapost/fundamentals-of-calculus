Newton's method fails in some cases.
As an example, suppose we have $f(x)=|x|^{1/4}$,
we want to find an $x$ such that $f(x)=0$, and we
start with $x_0=1$ as our initial guess. Of course this
is a silly application, since it's obvious that the
solution is $x=0$, but the point is to study a simple
example where the method fails. Find a formula for
$|x_n-x_{n-1}|$ in this example.
Then use this result in a proof by induction
to show that Newton's method fails.
