The figure shows a fountain in Sergel's Square, Stockholm, named after
the sculptor Sergel. The fountain was designed by 
architect David Helld\'en using a mathematical shape suggested by his friend,
the Danish mathematician,
poet, designer, and author Piet Hein. The equation of the shape is
\begin{equation*}
  x^{5/2}+y^{5/2} = a^{5/2} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $a$ is a constant. Find the units of $a$. Use implicit differentiation to find
the value of $\der y/\der x$ for this curve in terms of $y$ and $x$.
