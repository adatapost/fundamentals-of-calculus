The figure shows a fountain in Sergel's Square, Stockholm, named after
the sculptor Sergel. The fountain was designed by 
architect David Helld\'en using a mathematical shape suggested by his friend,
the Danish mathematician,
poet, designer, and author Piet Hein. The equation of the shape is
\begin{equation*}
  |x|^{5/2}+|y|^{5/2} = a^{5/2}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $a$ is a constant.
(a) Find the units of $a$.
(b) Use implicit differentiation to find
an extremely simple expression for  $\der y/\der x$ in terms of $y$ and $x$.
For simplicity, you can restrict your result to the first quadrant.
(Do not eliminate $y$ in favor of $x$, because that makes the expression more complicated.)
(c) Check that the units of your result make sense.
(d) Check that the sign of your result makes sense.
(e) Check that the result makes sense where the curve intersects the positive
$x$ and $y$ axes.
