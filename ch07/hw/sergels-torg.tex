The figure shows a fountain in Sergel's Square, Stockholm, named after
the sculptor Sergel. The fountain was designed by 
architect David Helld\'en using a mathematical shape suggested by his friend,
the Danish mathematician,
poet, designer, and author Piet Hein. The equation of the shape is
\begin{equation*}
  |x|^{5/2}+|y|^{5/2} = a^{5/2} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $a$ is a constant.
(a) Find the units of $a$.
(b) Use implicit differentiation to find
an extremely simple expression for  $\der y/\der x$ in terms of $y$ and $x$.
For simplicity, you can restrict your result to the first quadrant.
(Do not eliminate $y$ in favor of $x$, because that makes the expression more complicated.)
(c) Check that the sign of your result makes sense.
(d) Check that the result makes sense where the curve intersects the positive
$x$ and $y$ axes.
