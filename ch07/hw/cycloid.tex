The cycloid, figure \figref{hw-cycloid}, was introduced briefly in example \ref{eg:cams}, p.~\pageref{eg:cams}.
It is the shape traced out in space by a point on the rim of a rolling wheel (which in this
problem we take to have radius 1).
Its equation in Cartesian coordinates can be written as
\begin{equation*}
  x = \cos^{-1}(1-y)-\sqrt{y(2-y)}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
which can't be solved for $y$ in terms of $x$ (in the sense defined in section \ref{sec:impossible-integrals}).
Use Newton's method to find the value of $y$ corresponding to $x=1$, expressing your answer to five
decimal places.
