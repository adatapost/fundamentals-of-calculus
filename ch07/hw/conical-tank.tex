(a)
A conical water tank with vertex down
has height $h$, and radius $a$ at the top.
The water is being drained out at a rate of flow
$F=\der V/\der t$.
How fast is the depth $d$ of
the water decreasing, when $d$ has a certain value?
(b) Check that your answer to part a has units that
make sense.
(c) Evaluate your answer numerically for $a=12\ \munit$,
$h=30\ \munit$, $d=20\ \munit$, and $\der V/\der t=-1.4\times10^{-2}\ \munit^3/\sunit$.
