The British economist Robert Malthus (1766-1834)\index{Malthus, Robert}
theorized that the human population would tend to grow
exponentially with time, whereas the production of resources
such as food would grow only linearly, due to factors such as technological improvements.
Under these assumptions, the
population would then inevitably become too great to be fed,
resulting in an event now known as a Malthusian catastrophe, such as famine or
genocide. As an example, suppose that the production of food
in a certain country increases so that at time $t\ge0$, agriculture
can feed a population $2+t$ (in units of millions of
people), while the population (in the same units) equals $e^t$.
A Malthusian catastrophe will then occur at a time $t$ determined by
\begin{equation*}
  2+t = e^t \qquad .
\end{equation*}
Use Newton's method to determine $t$ to two decimal places.
