An astroid is the shape traced by a point on a circle of radius $a/4$ as it rolls
around the inside of a circle of radius $a$. Its equation is
\begin{equation*}
  x^{2/3}+y^{2/3} = a^{2/3} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
(a) Find the units of $a$.
(b) Use implicit differentiation to find
an extremely simple expression for $\der y/\der x$ in terms of $y$ and $x$.
(Do not eliminate $y$ in favor of $x$, because that makes the expression more complicated.)
(c) Check that the sign of your result is correct in all four quadrants of the graph.
(d) The notion of a \emph{cusp} was briefly introduced on p.~\pageref{fig:caustic};\index{cusp}
it is a horn-shaped point on a graph where the two branches are parallel when they
meet at the tip. From the figure, it's hard to tell whether the astroid has cusps
or whether there is a nonzero angle between the branches. Use your result to determine
which is the case.
