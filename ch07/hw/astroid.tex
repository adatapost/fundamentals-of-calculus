An astroid is the shape traced by a point on a circle of radius $a/4$ as it rolls
around the inside of a circle of radius $a$. Its equation is
\begin{equation*}
  x^{2/3}+y^{2/3} = a^{2/3}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
(a) Check that the units of the equation make sense.
(b) Use implicit differentiation to find
an extremely simple expression for $\der y/\der x$ in terms of $y$ and $x$.
(Do not eliminate $y$ in favor of $x$, because that makes the expression more complicated.)
(c) Check the units of your result.
(d) Check that the sign of your result is correct in all four quadrants of the graph.
(e) The notion of a \emph{cusp} was briefly introduced on p.~\pageref{fig:caustic};\index{cusp}
it is a horn-shaped point on a graph where the two branches are parallel when they
meet at the tip. From the figure, it's hard to tell whether the astroid has cusps
or whether there is a nonzero angle between the branches. Use your result to determine
which is the case.
