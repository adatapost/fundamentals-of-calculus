Figure \subfigref{hw-spaghetti}{1} shows a thin stick 
being compressed between a person's
hands. If the force is greater than a certain amount,
the stick will start to bow. Figure \subfigref{hw-spaghetti}{2}
is similar, but at the bottom the stick is constrained
so that it can't rotate; that is, its tangent is kept vertical.
The stick is stronger in this situation, and more force
is required before it will start to deform. The ratio of the
two forces can be shown to be $(x/\pi)^2$, where $x$ is the
smallest positive solution of the equation
\begin{equation*}
  \tan x = x \qquad .
\end{equation*}
Inspection of a graph of the tangent function shows that the
value of $x$ is approximately 4.5. Use Newton's method to improve
this approximation to six decimal places.\answercheck
