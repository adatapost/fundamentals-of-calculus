A point on the unit circle has coordinates $(x,y)=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$,
where $\theta$ is the angle measured counterclockwise from the $x$ axis.
If we want both sine and cosine to be negative, then we need a point on
the unit circle that lies in the third quadrant, excluding the points
that coincide with the axes. That means $\theta\in(\pi,3\pi/2)$.
