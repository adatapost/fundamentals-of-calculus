Taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero, we have $\left(e^x-e^{-x}\right)/2=0$, so $e^x=e^{-x}$, which
occurs only at $x=0$. The second derivative is $\left(e^x+e^{-x}\right)/2$ (the same as the original function),
which is positive for all $x$, so the function is everywhere concave up, and this is a minimum.
