The derivative of $e^{7x}$ is $e^{7x}\cdot 7$, where the first factor is the
derivative of the outside stuff (the derivative of a base-$e$ exponential is
just the same thing), and the second factor is the derivative of the inside stuff.
This would normally be written as $7e^{7x}$.

The  derivative of the second function is $e^{e^x}e^x$, with the second exponential factor coming
from the chain rule.
