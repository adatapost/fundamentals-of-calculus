We need to put together three different ideas here: (1) When a function to be
differentiated is multiplied by a constant, the constant just comes along for the ride.                                        
(2) The derivative of the sine is the cosine. (3) We need to use the chain rule.
The result is $ab\cos(bx+c)$.
