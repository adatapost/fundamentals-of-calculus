The approximation we're going to use is
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der y}{\der x} \approx \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
Since we want an answer valid to three decimal places, it might
be reasonable to try a $\Delta x$ value such as 0.0001, since that's
a lot smaller than $10^{-3}$. We then have:
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{1/(1-0.0001)-1/(1-0)}{0.0001-0} = 1.00010
\end{equation*}
It looks like we're getting 1 as our answer. To see if the result is really
valid to three decimal places, we can try making $\Delta x$ smaller, and see how
much the result changes. With $\Delta x=10^{-5}$, we get  1.00001. The change
is in the fifth decimal place, so it looks like the first three decimal places
are correct.
% calc -e "dx=.0001; (1/(1-dx)-1)/dx"
%    1.00010001000017
%calc -e "dx=.00001; (1/(1-dx)-1)/dx"
%    1.0000100000962
