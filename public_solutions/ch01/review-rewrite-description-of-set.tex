We have a set of points that are included in the set, which are those
for which the given polynomial is negative. The set of points that are
not included are those for which the polynomial is zero or positive.
There is an edge or boundary between these two sets, consisting of
any points at which the polynomial is zero, i.e., the roots of the polynomial.
We could use the quadratic formula to find these roots. But since
$u=0$ is clearly a root, it's simpler just to factor the polynomial
into $u(u-2)$, which tells us that the other root is $2$.
Clearly the set S must be either the interval $(0,2)$ or
everything that lies \emph{outside} this interval. Checking
$u=1$, we see that it's the former possibility that holds. Thus
a simpler description is $\zu{S}=\{u|u>0\ \text{and}\ u<2\}$.
