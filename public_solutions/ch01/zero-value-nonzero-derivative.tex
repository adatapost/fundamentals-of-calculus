Let $m$ be the national budget surplus. For a brief period
in an economic boom during the Clinton administration, the U.S.~federal government
had a budget surplus, so $m$ was positive. Later, the economy cooled down and $m$ became
negative again --- which is its normal state in the modern era. At some point in
time $t$, $m$ had to change from being positive to being negative, so $m(t)=0$.
At that moment, $m$ was decreasing, so $m(t)<0$.
