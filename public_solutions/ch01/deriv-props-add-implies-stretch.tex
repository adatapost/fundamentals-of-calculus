When the vertical stretch factor $r$ is a natural number, that means
that the function $rf$ can be written as $f+f+\ldots+f$, where the
number of terms in the sum is $r$. By the addition property of the
derivative, the derivative of $rf$ is then $f'+f'+\ldots+f'$, which
is the same as $rf'$. This is the vertical stretch property.
