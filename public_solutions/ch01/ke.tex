This is similar to problem \ref{hw:observable-universe}, in that it looks scary, but we can rewrite
it as a simple monomial, $K=(1/2)mv^2=(1/2)m(at)^2=(ma^2/2)t^2$. The derivative is
$(ma^2/2)(2t)=ma^2t$. The car needs more and more power to accelerate as its speed increases.

To check the units, we just need to show that the expression $ma^2t$ has units that are like
those of the original expression for $K$, but divided by seconds, since it's a rate of
change of $K$ over time. This indeed works out, since the only change in the factors that
aren't unitless is the reduction of the powet of $t$ from 2 to 1.
