Thinking of the rocket's height as a function of time, we can see that goal is to measure
the function at its maximum. The derivative is zero at the maximum, so the error incurred
due to timing is approximately zero. She should not worry about the timing error too much.
Other factors are likely to be more important, e.g., the rocket may not rise exactly
vertically above the launchpad.
