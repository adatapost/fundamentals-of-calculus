The graph fails the vertical line test: a vertical line can pass through more than one point
on the graph, meaning that there can be more than one pressure for a given temperature.
Therefore $p$ is not a function of $T$.

If we were to interchange the axes of the graph, it would pass the vertical line test.
Therefore $T$ can be described as a function of $p$. For a given pressure, there is only
one temperature.
