The derivative is a rate of change, so the derivatives of the constants 1 and 7, which don't change, are
clearly zero. The derivative can be interpreted geometrically as the slope of the tangent line, and since
the functions $t$ and $7t$ \emph{are} lines, their derivatives are simply their slopes, 1, and 7. 
All of these could also have been found using the formula that says the derivative of $t^k$ is
$kt^{k-1}$, but it wasn't really necessary to get that fancy.
To find the derivative of $t^2$, we can use the formula, which gives $2t$. One of the properties of
the derivative is that multiplying a function by a constant multiplies its derivative by the same
constant, so the derivative of $7t^2$ must be $(7)(2t)=14t$. By similar reasoning, the derivatives
of $t^3$ and $7t^3$ are $3t^2$ and $21t^2$, respectively.
