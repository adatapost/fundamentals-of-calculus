(a) Using the chain rule, the derivative of $(x^2+1)^{1/2}$ is $(1/2)(x^2+1)^{-1/2}(2x)=x(x^2+1)^{-1/2}$.\\
(b) This is the same as a, except that the 1 is replaced with an $a^2$, so the answer is $x(x^2+a^2)^{-1/2}$. The idea
would be that $a$ has the same units as $x$.\\
(c) This can be rewritten as $(a+x)^{-1/2}$, giving a derivative of $(-1/2)(a+x)^{-3/2}$.\\
(d) This is similar to c, but we pick up a factor of $-2x$ from the chain rule, making the result
$ax(a-x^2)^{-3/2}$.
