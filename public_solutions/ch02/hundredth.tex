This would be a horrible problem if we had to expand this as a polynomial with 101 terms,
as in chapter \ref{ch:derivative}! But now we know the chain rule, so it's easy. The derivative is
\begin{equation*}
  \left[100(2x+3)^{99}\right][2] \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where the first factor in brackets is the derivative of the function on the outside, and
the second one is the derivative of the ``inside stuff.'' Simplifying a little, the
answer is $200(2x+3)^{99}$.
