Let P be the point $(1,1)$, and let Q lie on the graph at $x=1+\der x$.
The slope of the line through P and Q is
\begin{align*}
  \text{slope of line PQ} &= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \\
               &= \frac{(1+\der x)^3-1}{(1+\der x)-1} \\
               &= \frac{3\der x+3\der x^2+\der x^3}{\der x} \\
\end{align*}
Discarding the $\der x^2$ and $\der x^3$ terms, this becomes
3, which is the same as the result we got by doing limits.
