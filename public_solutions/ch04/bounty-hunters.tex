Clearly $f$ will be a non-decreasing function and will asymptotically
approach 1 as $x$ approaches infinity. We can also say something about
the value of $f'(0)$. Bounty hunting is a nasty, dirty, dangerous business
that requires a significant up-front investment. Therefore we don't
expect any bounty hunters to become active unless $x$ is high enough
to give them some expectation of making a profit, and we expect
both $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=0$, and the function should be essentially
zero until it starts to rise at some finite value of $x$.
