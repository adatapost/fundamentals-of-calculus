If $f''$ is continuous and sometimes positive and sometimes negative,
then by the intermediate value theorem there is a point where $f''(x)=0$.
(This is the part of the argument that fails for a function on the rationals.)
Furthermore, we must have some such $x$ at which $f''$ changes sign,
and this is by definition a point of inflection.
