For $x$ approaching $\pm\infty$, the $x^2$ term dominates, and
the function approaches zero. Therefore the function
has a horizontal asymptote at zero.

Each root of the polynomial in the denominator will correspond to
a vertical asymptote. These roots can be determined from the
quadratic formula, which contains the square root of $b^2-4ac$,
called the discriminant. If the discriminant is greater than zero,
then there will be two asymptotes, corresponding to the positive
and negative roots of the discriminant. If the discriminant is
zero, then there will be only one real root and one vertical
asymptote. If the discriminant is negative, then there are no
real roots and no vertical asymptotes.
