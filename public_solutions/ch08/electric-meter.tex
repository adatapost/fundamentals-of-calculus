The proposed relationships are:
\begin{align*}
  I &= k\frac{\der C}{\der t} \\
  I &= k\int_{t_1}^{t_2} C \: \der t
\end{align*}
A derivative represents a rate of change, while an integral
represents the accumulation of change. Based on these concepts,
the first equation makes sense: the current tells us how fast
our accumulated bill is adding up. The second one doesn't
make sense conceptually.
