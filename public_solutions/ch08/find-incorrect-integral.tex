\begin{equation*}
   \int x\:\der x = \frac{1}{2}x^2+c \\
\end{equation*}
Differentiating the right-hand side gives $\frac{1}{2}(2x)=x$, which is
correct. (The derivative of the constant term is zero.)

\begin{equation*}
   \int x^4\:\der x = 4x^5+c \\
\end{equation*}
Differentiating the right-hand side would give $20x^4$, which is wrong.
The coefficient on the right should be 1/5, not 4.

\begin{equation*}
   \int e^x\:\der x = e^x+c \\
\end{equation*}
Differentiation gives $e^x$, which is right.

\begin{equation*}
   \int e^{2x}\:\der x = e^{2x}+c
\end{equation*}
Differentiation gives $2e^{2x}$, where the factor of 2 in front comes
from the chain rule. The integral is wrong as written. It should have
a factor of $1/2$ in front.

\begin{equation*}
   \int x^{-1}\:\der x = x^0+c \\
\end{equation*}
This is wrong. Raising something to the power 0 simply gives 1, so the
right-hand side is $1+c$, which is a constant. If we differentiate it,
we get zero, not $x^{-1}$. As in example \ref{eg:integrate-1-over-x},
p.~\pageref{eg:integrate-1-over-x}, the correct integral is $\ln x+c$.
