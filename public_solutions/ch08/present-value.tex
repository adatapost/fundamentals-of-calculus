The two options proposed are:
\begin{align*}
  \zu{PV} &= \frac{\der}{\der t} \left(e^{-rT}f(t)\right) \\
  \zu{PV} &= \int_0^T f(t)e^{-rt}\:\der t
\end{align*}
The units of the present value should be dollars.

The first proposed equation is nonsense based on units,
because $f$ has units of dollars/year, and its time derivative would therefore have units
of $\zu{dollars}/\zu{year}^2$, not dollars.

The units of the second equation do make sense. The Leibniz notation for the
integral is designed so that if you analyze the units and treat the integral sign
as a sum, the units are what they look like they are. On the right-hand side, the
units are $(\zu{dollars}/\zu{year})\times\zu{years}=\zu{dollars}$, which matches
the units on the left-hand side. This doesn't prove that this equation is right,
but it doesn't prove it wrong, either.
