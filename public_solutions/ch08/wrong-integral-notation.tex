(a)
\begin{equation*}
  \int_0^1 x \qquad
\end{equation*}
This one is wrong because it's written ungrammatically. It's wrong without the
$\der x$, for the reasons explained on p.~\pageref{why-you-need-dx}.

\begin{equation*}
  \int_0^1 x\:\der x \qquad
\end{equation*}
This one is correct.

\begin{equation*}
  \int_0^1 u\:\der u 
\end{equation*}
This one is also correct. It doesn't matter that a different letter is used. The $x$ or $u$ is
just a dummy variable.

(b) The correct way to notate this is $\int \left(x^2+1\right)\:\der x$,
so that the differential $\der x$ is being multiplied by the whole expression.
The notation $\int x^2+1 \:\der x$ makes it look like the $\der x$ is only
multiplying the 1.
