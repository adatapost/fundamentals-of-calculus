(a) As described in the instructions above the problem,
force has units of newtons (N). Since distance is measured in meters (m),
the constant $k$ must have units of $\nunit/\munit$.\\
(b)
\begin{equation*}
  W = \int_0^b kx\:\der x = \left.\frac{1}{2}kx^2\right]_0^b = \frac{1}{2}kb^2
\end{equation*}
(c) As described in the instructions, work has units of $\nunit\unitdot\munit$,
so we need to check that the expression $(1/2)kb^2$ also has these units.
The 1/2 is unitless. The constant $k$ has units of $\nunit/\munit$, and multiplying
these units by meters squares does give $\nunit\unitdot\munit$.
