We have the same power law for differentials as for derivatives, so the result is $52 B^{51}\der B$. Note that
the answer is wrong without the $\der B$. If we think of differentials as ``a little bit of\ldots,''
then $\der(B^{52})$ means a tiny change in $B^{52}$. It can't equal $52 B^{51}$, because $52 B^{51}$ is not typically
going to be tiny.
