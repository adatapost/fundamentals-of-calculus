\begin{align*}
  & e^{x+y}\der x + x e^{x+y}(\der x+\der y) + \der y = 0 \\
  & \left(e^{x+y}+xe^{x+y}\right)\der x + \left(xe^{x+y}+1\right)\der y = 0 \\
  & \frac{\der y}{\der x} = -\left(\frac{1+x}{1+xe^{x+y}}\right)e^{x+y}
\end{align*}
Plugging in $x=0$ and $y=0$ gives $\der y/\der x=-1$.
% Checked by checking that near the origin, exponential is approx 1, so curve is approx x+y=0.
