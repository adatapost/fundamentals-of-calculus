Applying l'H\^{o}pital's rule once gives
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{u\rightarrow 0} \frac{2u}{e^u-e^{-u}} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
which is still an indeterminate form. Applying the rule a second time, we get
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{u\rightarrow 0} \frac{2}{e^u+e^{-u}} = 1 \qquad .
\end{equation*}
As a numerical check, plugging $u=0.01$ into the original expression results
in $0.9999917$.
