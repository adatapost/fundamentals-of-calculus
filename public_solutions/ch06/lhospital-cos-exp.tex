Both numerator and denominator go to zero, so we can apply l'H\^{o}pital's rule. Differentiating top and bottom gives
$(\cos x-x\sin x)/(-\ln 2 \cdot 2^x)$, which equals $-1/ln 2$ at $x=0$. To check this numerically, we plug 
$x=10^{-3}$ into the original expression. The result is $-1.44219$, which is very close to $-1/ln 2=-1.44269\ldots$.
