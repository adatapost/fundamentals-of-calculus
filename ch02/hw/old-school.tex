We've established the power rule using limits, which are the most
common modern tool for defining derivatives. By this rule, the
derivative of $x^3$ is $3x^2$, and evaluating this at $x=1$ gives
a derivative of 3.

Chapter \ref{ch:limits} began by showing a more old-fashioned technique
for differentiating $x^2$ at $x=1$ (p.~\pageref{discard-dx-squared}). Apply this
technique to $x^3$ at $x=1$, and show that it agrees with the result found above.
