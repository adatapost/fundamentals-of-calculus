Let the function $f$ be defined as $f(x)=1/\sin x$, where the sine function takes
its argument in radians.
Where is $f$ discontinuous? Where is it nondifferentiable?
You do not have to \emph{evaluate} the derivative
in order to answer this question, but you do need to recall basic properties of
the sine function. If you've forgotten your trig, you may need
to look at the review in section \ref{sec:trig}, p.~\pageref{sec:trig}.
