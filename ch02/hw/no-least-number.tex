The number 1 can be defined as the smallest positive integer.
(a) Recall that rational numbers are defined as the ratios of integers, i.e.,
fractions such as $2/3$. Give a proof by contradiction
to show that there is no smallest positive rational number.
Proof by contradiction was introduced in box
\figref{proof-by-contradiction} on p.~\pageref{fig:proof-by-contradiction}.
(b) Suppose that someone proposes interpreting a symbol like $\der x$ as the
smallest positive \emph{real} number that exists. Assume the properties of
the real numbers given in section \ref{sec:elementary-reals},
p.~\pageref{sec:elementary-reals}. Prove
that there is no such least real number.
