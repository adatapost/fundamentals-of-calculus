Recall from p.~\pageref{rational-function-defined} that a rational function is
the quotient of two polynomials. Define the nastiness, $N[r]$ of a rational
function $r$ to be the sum of the orders of its numerator and denominator,
when it has already been simplified as much as possible. For example,
\begin{equation*}
  N\left[\frac{3x^4+1}{x^2-1}\right] = 4+2=6 \qquad .
\end{equation*}
If we take the derivative of a rational function, the result is again
a rational function. We may get lucky and
find that the result can be simplified, but in most cases the result will
be more complicated than the original function, as measured by nastiness.
Determine an upper bound on $N[r']$, stated as an inequality in terms of
$N[r]$.
