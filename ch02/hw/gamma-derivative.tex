Suppose that we put a stick on a table and use a ruler
to measure its length $L$.
According to Einstein's theory of special relativity,
if the stick is in motion at speed $v$ relative to the ruler, then
we get a different, shorter length given by
\begin{equation*}
  M = L\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $c$ is the speed of light. We don't notice this effect in
everyday life because ordinary velocities are so small compared
to $c$.
Calculate $\der M/\der v$, the rate at which the stick shortens
with increasing speed. Check the units of your answer.\answercheck
