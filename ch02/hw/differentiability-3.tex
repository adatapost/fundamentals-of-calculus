A cusp is a special type of kink, in which the two branches are parallel
       where they meet. An example is shown in figure \figref{caustic}
on p.~\pageref{fig:caustic}. For which values of the exponent $p$
does the function $f(x)=|x|^p$ have a cusp at $x=0$? For which values 
is it nondifferentiable?
