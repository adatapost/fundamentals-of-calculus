One car is driving north, along the $y$ axis, so that at time
$t$ its $y$ coordinate is $y=t$. Another car is driving west,
along the $x$ axis, with $x$ coordinate $x=1-t$. Initially,
at $t=0$, the second car is aimed straight at the first one.\hwendpart
(a) Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the function $r(t)$ giving the distance $r$ between
the two cars at time $t$. Eliminate $x$ and $y$ from your expression
by using the equations above, so that it only has $t$ in it.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Find the time at which the distance is at a minimum. (You may find it helpful
to employ the shortcut demonstrated in the solution to problem \ref{hw:resonance}.)\answercheck\hwendpart
