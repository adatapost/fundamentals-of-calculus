(a) Consider the function $f(x)=xe^x$, where $e$ is the base of natural logarithms.
Use the technique described in section \ref{subsec:approximating-deriv}, p.~\pageref{subsec:approximating-deriv}, to find
$f'(1)$, to three decimal places of precision.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) In example \ref{eg:exponential-with-limits}, p.~\pageref{eg:exponential-with-limits},
we conjectured that the derivative of $e^x$ was simply $e^x$. This is discussed in
greater detail in ch.~\ref{ch:more-derivatives}, but for now let's just assume that
it's true. Given this fact, use the product rule to differentiate the function $f$.
Check that the result is consistent with your answer to part a.\answercheck\hwendpart
