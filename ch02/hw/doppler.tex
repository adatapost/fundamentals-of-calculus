Suppose that a distant galaxy is moving away from us at some fraction
$u$ of the speed of light. Then the vibration of the light waves we
receive from it is slowed down by the factor
\begin{equation*}
  D(u) = \sqrt{\frac{1-u}{1+u}}
\end{equation*}
compared to what we would have observed if it hadn't been in motion
relative to us. This is called the Doppler effect. Compute the derivative
$\der D/\der u$, which measures how sensitive the effect is to the velocity.\answercheck
