A computer language will typically have a built-in
subroutine that produces a fairly random number that is equally
likely to take on any value in the range from 0 to 1. If you
take the absolute value of the difference between two such
numbers, the probability distribution is of the form
$D(x)=k(1-x)$. (a) Find the value of the constant $k$
that is required by normalization.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Find the average value of $x$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Find the standard deviation.\answercheck\hwendpart
