A laser is placed one meter away from a wall, and spun
on the ground to give it a random direction, but if the angle $\theta$ shown in the figure
 doesn't
come out in the range from 0 to $\pi/2$, the laser is spun again until
an angle in the desired range is obtained.\\
(a) Find the probability distribution $D_\theta$ of the variable $\theta$.\\
(b) Using the technique described in section \ref{subsec:probability-related-variables}
on p.~\pageref{subsec:probability-related-variables}, find the probability distribution
$D_x$ of the distance $x$ shown in the figure.\answercheck
