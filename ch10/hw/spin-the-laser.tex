A laser is placed one meter away from a wall, and spun
on the ground to give it a random direction, but if the angle $\theta$ shown in the figure
 doesn't
come out in the range from 0 to $\pi/2$, the laser is spun again until
an angle in the desired range is obtained. Find the probability distribution
of the distance $x$ shown in the figure.\answercheck
