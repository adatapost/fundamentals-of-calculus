        A blimp is initially at rest, hovering, when at $t=0$ the
        pilot turns on the engine driving the propeller. The engine cannot
        instantly get the propeller going, but the propeller speeds
        up steadily. The steadily increasing force between the air
        and the propeller is given by the equation $F=kt$, where $k$ is
        a constant.
(a) Infer the units of $k$.
(b) Find the blimp's momentum as a function of time.\answercheck
(c) Check that your answer to part b has the right units.
