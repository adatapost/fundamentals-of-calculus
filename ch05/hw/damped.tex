If an object is vibrating, and the vibration is gradually dying out,
its motion is typically of the form
\begin{equation*}
  x(t) = A\cos(\omega t+\delta)e^{-bt} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $A$, $\omega$, $\delta$, and $b$ are constants.\\
(a) Infer the units of each of the four constants, and give a physical interpretation.
(For examples of how to infer the units, see
example \ref{eg:whirling-bucket} on p.~\pageref{eg:whirling-bucket},
example \ref{eg:caffeine} on p.~\pageref{eg:caffeine},
and problem \ref{hw:equilibrating-temperature} above.)
