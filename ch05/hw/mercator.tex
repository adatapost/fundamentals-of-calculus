On a map drawn using a Mercator projection, the $y$ coordinate on the paper
is given by $y=a \tanh^{-1}\sin\phi$, where $\phi$ is the latitude and $a$
is a constant. Find the derivative $\der y/\der\phi$, which indicates the
latitude-dependent scale of the map in the north-south direction.\answercheck
