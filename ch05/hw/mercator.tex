On a map drawn using a Mercator projection, the $y$ coordinate on the paper
is given by $y=a \tanh^{-1}\sin\phi$, where $\phi$ is the latitude, $a$
is a constant, and the inverse hyperbolic tangent function is defined on
p.~\pageref{def-hyperbolic}. (a) Find the derivative $\der y/\der\phi$, which indicates the
latitude-dependent scale of the map in the north-south direction.
(b) The approximations $\tanh x\approx x$ and $\sin x\approx x$ are valid for small $x$.
Use these approximations to approximate the behavior of $y(\phi)$ for small $\phi$,
and use this to check your answer to part a.
