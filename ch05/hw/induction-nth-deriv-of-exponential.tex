Proof by induction was introduced in section \ref{subsec:natural-powers}, p.~\pageref{induction}.
Use induction to prove that
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der^n}{\der x^n} b^x = (\ln b)^n b^x\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
To understand what's going on, you may wish to calculate the first few derivatives; however,
doing this and observing the pattern does not constitute a proof.
