A cold bottle of beer is left outside under a shady tree
at a picnic. Its temperature as a function of time is given
by
\begin{equation*}
  T = a - b e^{-ct} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.\\
(a) Infer the units of $a$, $b$, and $c$\hwendpart
(b) Find the derivative $\der T/\der t$, which measures how fast the beer
is warming up. Check that its units make sense.\hwendpart
(c) Interpret both the original equation and
your answer to part b in the limit where $t\rightarrow\infty$.\hwendpart
(d) Interpret the constants $a$, $b$, and $c$ physically.
