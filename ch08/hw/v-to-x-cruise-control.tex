If a car on cruise control has the wrong speed at $t=0$, it will take some time
for the system to correct the error. The system may be designed to
produce a velocity as a function of time given by
\begin{equation*}
  v = u+be^{-rt}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $u$ is the desired speed, $r$ is a constant chosen by the designer,
and $b$ is the initial error in velocity, which may be positive or
negative. The value of $r$ is a design compromise; if $r$ is too small, then
it will take a long time for the car to get back to the right speed, but if
it is too big, the motion will be jerky or produce bad fuel efficiency.\\
(a) Infer the units of $u$, $b$, and $r$.\hwendpart
