(a) Which of the following are correct ways of notating the area of a right triangle
with both legs of length 1?
\begin{equation*}
  \int_0^1 x \qquad
  \int_0^1 x\:\der x \qquad
  \int_0^1 u\:\der u 
\end{equation*}
(b) The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=x^2+1$.
Why is it wrong to notate the antiderivative of $f$ as $\int x^2+1 \:\der x$?
