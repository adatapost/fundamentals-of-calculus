The figure shows an archer drawing a longbow. When the string
is pulled back to a distance $x$ relative to its straight equilibrium position,
the force required from the right hand is given approximately by $F=kx$, where
$k$ is a constant. (a) 
Infer the units of $k$.
(b) Find the amount of work done in pulling the bow from $x=0$ to $x=b$, where
$b$ is some number.
(c) Check that the units of your result make sense.
