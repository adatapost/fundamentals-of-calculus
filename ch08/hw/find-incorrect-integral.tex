One or more of the following indefinite integrals is incorrect.
As described in section \ref{subsec:checking-an-integral}, use differentiation
to find which are correct and which are incorrect. If they're incorrect, fix what's wrong.
\begin{align*}
  & \int x\:\der x = \frac{1}{2}x^2+c \\
  & \int x^4\:\der x = 4x^5+c \\
  & \int e^x\:\der x = e^x+c \\
  & \int e^{2x}\:\der x = e^{2x}+c \\
  & \int x^{-1}\:\der x = x^0+c 
\end{align*}
