One or more of the following antiderivatives is incorrect.
As described in section \ref{subsec:checking-an-integral}, use differentiation
to find which are incorrect. Fix any incorrect ones.
\begin{align*}
  & \int x\:\der x = \frac{1}{2}x^2+c       & \int e^{2x}\:\der x = e^{2x}+c \\
  & \int x^4\:\der x = 4x^5+c               & \int x^{-1}\:\der x = x^0+c  \\
  & \int e^x\:\der x = e^x+c 
\end{align*}
